# Definition
Real function defined over elliptical curve field $E$ if exists $P \in E$ and $n \in \mathbb N$ such that main divisor in $P$ have the following representation: $Div(f)(P) = nP - [nP] - (n-1)O$.

Let is real function defined for divisors on elliptical curve. Then following condition should be held: $supp(Div(f)) \cap supp(Div(E)) = \emptyset$.
So real function over divisor is defined as: $f(Div(E)) = \prod_{P \in E} f(P)^{C_{P}}$.
# Theorem (Law of Weil reciprocity)
Let $f$ and $g$ are real functions defined over elliptical curve $E$, then $f(Div(g)) = g(Div(f))$
