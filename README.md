# Math

Some essential math topics devoted pure math theory and applicational ones.

These theoretical basis covers Computer Science areas such as:
* Cryptography (in a very close [look](https://github.com/mstrielnikov/Cryptography#cryptography))
* Information encoding & image processing
* Fast computer arithmetics algorithms
* Fuzzy logic and AI related math

**Recommendations**
Topics pretend to be independent from each other as much as possible. There is no matter which topic you start from with almost no exceptions.
My recommendations:
* To start [Elliptical curves](https://github.com/mstrielnikov/Math#elliptical-curves) only after [Number theory](https://github.com/mstrielnikov/Math#number-theory) and [Abstract algebra](https://github.com/mstrielnikov/Math#abstract-algebra) (in any order).
