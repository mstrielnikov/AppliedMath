# Math

Some essential math topics devoted pure math theory and applicational ones.

These theoretical basis covers Computer Science areas such as:
* Cryptography (in a very close [look](https://github.com/mstrielnikov/Cryptography#cryptography))
* Information encoding & image processing
* Fast computer arithmetics algorithms
* Fuzzy logic and AI related math

Main topics listed below.
