    "\n",
    "$$ x^2 = x * x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithmic complexity**. So, we put _n_ as a length of the number _x_, then squaring will require $O(n^2)$ of elementary one digit summations and $O(n^2)$ space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>1.2 Squaring by summation with itself</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We could think that square of _x_ is  sum of _x_ with itself _x_ times:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^2 = \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{x} x $$\n",

    "Put $ x_{bin} $ as number in binary  system, _N_ number of digits in binary representation, $ b_{i} $ is every single bit.\n",
    "Then any number could be written as series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{bin} = \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n} (2^{i}*b_{i}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to square any number _x_ we need double _x_ for every $ b_{i} $ bit equals *0* then double and add _x_ for every $ b_{i} $ bit equals *1*.\n",
    "We could write down that condition for each bit on every _i_-th iteration step as $ s_{i} $:\n",
