    "Trivial square formulae is a well known for the most fields. It is often represented as a trivial multiplication of element by itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^2 = x \\circ x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication is often a **combination** for descrete elements. It is easy to see for rectangle on fig. 1. In our case length and with are the same value _x_.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Fig 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we put _n_ as a length of the number _x_, then squaring will require $O(n^2)$ of elementary one digit summations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Squaring number geometrically by filling square with repeatable pattern</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We could enable geometric intuintion and represent squaring not a **combination** but in way of repeatable **pattern filling**. We may fill square with some angle-like pattern which decreases while going from one corner to another diagonally (fig. 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Fig 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have length and width which is equal _2n_ but angled elementary square should be included just once, so we get length _2n-1_ for one angled pattern. We are going to repeat the pattern and get following sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{x} (2i-1) = x^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulae we get is reccurent so it the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{i+1} = f_{i}+2, i \\in [ 1; x ] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we got sufficient optimization. We just need to reuse previous result by adding 2 _n_-times which is $ n*O(1) \\rightarrow O(n) $ complexity operation.\n",

    "<h2>Squaring number geometrically by traversing square in spiral like pattern</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine square computation as traversing a square by spiral without self intersections (fig. 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Fig 3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But, for square with odd length _x_ it will resulting to square _x-1_ with correction by two addtional sides (Fig 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Fig 4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Put _x_ as even.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{x/2} (8i-4)  $$\n",

    "$$ f(x) = 4 \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{x/2} (2i-1)  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If _x_ is odd, we will get:\n",
